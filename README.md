# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
# Step 1:
Import the required library (numpy) in Python to perform matrix operations.

# Step 2:
Define the matrix for which the rank is to be calculated.

# Step 3:
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.

# Step 4:
Display the rank of the matrix as the output 
## Program:
```

import numpy as np
A = np.array([[5, -3, -10],[2, 2, -3],[-3, -1, 5]])
B= np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
print(B)

```
## Output:
